            <Text variant="secondary">
              Surgery Care Foundation is a registered non-profit organisation
              that raises funds for verified medical surgeries on behalf of
              patients who cannot afford treatment. The Foundation is
              <strong> not a hospital, not a medical practitioner, and does
              not itself provide medical care.</strong> Surgical care is
              delivered by independent partner hospitals. The Foundation acts
              as the bridge between donors and the treating hospital and
              releases donated funds directly to the hospital&rsquo;s account
              against an invoice.

              Every campaign undergoes review by the Foundation&rsquo;s team

              medical diagnosis, hospital cost estimate, hospital
              accreditation, and the family&rsquo;s financial situation. The
              Foundation reserves the right to decline, pause, modify or
              remove any campaign without notice if information is incomplete,
              suspect, or in breach of these Terms.
