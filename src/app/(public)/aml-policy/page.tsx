              Surgery Care Foundation is committed to ensuring that donations
              received through the Site are not used to launder money,
              finance terrorism, or fund any other illegal activity. This
              Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy sets out the standards we
              follow in line with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,
              2002 (PMLA), the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the
              Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA, where
              applicable), and the Reserve Bank of India&rsquo;s
              KYC/AML directions applicable to payment aggregators.
