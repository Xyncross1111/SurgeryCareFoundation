          <PolicySection title="1. We are not a medical service provider">
            <Text variant="secondary">
              Surgery Care Foundation is a registered non-profit organisation
              that funds surgical care for patients who cannot afford
              treatment. The Foundation is not a hospital, clinic, diagnostic
              centre or healthcare provider, and does not employ any medical
              practitioner. All clinical decisions, surgical procedures,
              admission, anaesthesia, post-operative care and prescriptions
              are the sole responsibility of the partnered hospital and the
              treating doctor selected for the patient.

          <PolicySection title="2. No guarantee of medical outcome">
            <Text variant="secondary">
              The Foundation makes every effort to fund surgeries promptly and
              to coordinate care with reputed hospitals. However, surgical
              outcomes depend on a wide range of clinical and individual
              factors that are outside the Foundation&rsquo;s control. We do
              not warrant or guarantee any particular medical outcome,
              recovery timeline, or success rate for any patient listed on
              the Site.

          <PolicySection title="3. Information accuracy">
            <Text variant="secondary">
              Patient stories, medical conditions, photographs, hospital
              estimates and other information published on a campaign page
              are submitted by the patient or an authorised family member and
              are verified by the Foundation&rsquo;s team to the best of our
              ability. We rely on the documents and information provided by
              the campaigner; we cannot guarantee absolute accuracy or
              completeness of every detail. If you believe a campaign
              contains inaccurate or misleading information, please report it
              using the contact below.

          <PolicySection title="4. Tax benefit eligibility">
            <Text variant="secondary">
              Donations to Surgery Care Foundation are eligible for deduction
              under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 1961, subject to the
              terms of our 80G certificate. Whether you can actually claim
              the deduction in your return depends on your individual tax
              position, the regime you have chosen and changes in tax law.
              The Foundation does not provide tax advice; please consult a
              qualified tax advisor.

            <Text variant="secondary">
              The Site is operated from India and is intended for donors
              within India. Nothing on the Site constitutes a solicitation of
              donations in any jurisdiction in which such solicitation would
              be unlawful or in which the Foundation is not authorised to
              receive donations. Foreign-currency donations are subject to
              FCRA registration and are not currently accepted through the
              Site (see our Donation Policy).

              The Foundation is not liable for any delay or failure in
              processing donations, disbursing funds, or coordinating medical
              care that arises from circumstances outside its reasonable
              control, including natural disasters, pandemics, payment-gateway
              outages, government action, civil unrest, or breakdown of
              essential infrastructure.
