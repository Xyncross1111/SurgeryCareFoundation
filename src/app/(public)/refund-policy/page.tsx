            <Text variant="secondary">
              Donations made to Surgery Care Foundation are voluntary
              charitable contributions intended to fund the surgical treatment
              of patients in need. Once a donation is successfully processed
              and applied to a patient&rsquo;s campaign, it is generally
              non-refundable. The exceptions below describe the limited
              circumstances under which a refund may be granted.

          <PolicySection title="2. Failed or duplicate transactions">
            <Text variant="secondary">
              If your bank or UPI app debits an amount but the donation does
              not reflect on the Site, the transaction is considered failed.
              Such amounts are typically auto-reversed by the payment gateway
              within 5 to 10 working days without any action required on your
              part. If a duplicate charge appears for the same intended
              donation, write to us within 7 days of the transaction with the
              transaction reference and we will arrange a refund of the
              duplicate amount to the original payment method.

              If you have donated by mistake (for example, an incorrect amount
              or to the wrong campaign), you may request a refund within
              <strong> 7 calendar days</strong> of the donation. Refund
              requests received after this window will be considered only at
              the Foundation&rsquo;s discretion and only if the funds have not
              already been disbursed to the partnered hospital.

              Surgery Care Foundation releases collected funds directly to the
              partnered hospital&rsquo;s bank account against the
              hospital&rsquo;s invoice for the patient&rsquo;s surgery. After
              the funds have been released, the donation cannot be refunded.
              At that stage your contribution has already been applied to the
              clinical care of the patient.

              our Terms of Use), the Foundation will contact contributing

              Approved refunds are initiated within 5 working days of receiving
              a complete request. Once initiated, the refund typically reflects
              in the original payment method within an additional 5 to 10
              working days, depending on your card issuer or bank. The
              Foundation has no control over the bank&rsquo;s internal
              processing time.
