              This Donation Policy explains how Surgery Care Foundation accepts
              contributions, how those contributions are tied to a specific
              patient&rsquo;s surgery, how funds reach the hospital, and how
              you receive your 80G tax-benefit receipt.

              We do not accept cash donations through the Site. As per the
              Income Tax Act, cash donations above &#8377; 2,000 are not
              eligible for 80G deduction in any case; we therefore restrict
              all donations to digital channels.

            <Text variant="secondary">
              The minimum donation is &#8377; 100. There is no maximum cap on
              the Site, however donations of &#8377; 50,000 or more in a
              single transaction may trigger Know-Your-Customer (KYC)
              verification by the payment gateway in line with the Prevention
              of Money Laundering Act, 2002. See our AML Policy for details.

              You may choose to donate anonymously, in which case your name
              will not appear in the public donor list on the campaign page.
              Anonymity does not exempt you from providing PAN if you wish to
              claim 80G tax benefit, nor from KYC if your donation triggers
              the threshold under Section 4 above.

              Surgery Care Foundation holds a Section 80G certificate, which

            <Text variant="secondary">
              Donations from foreign sources can only be accepted if and when
              the Foundation holds a valid registration under the Foreign
              Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA). Until such
              registration is in place, please do not send foreign-currency
              contributions through the Site. Any inadvertent foreign
              contribution will be returned to the source.

              The Foundation does not deduct any platform fee or commission

              under 2%) are absorbed by the Foundation&rsquo;s operations
              budget so that the maximum possible amount reaches the patient.

              supported, including pre-surgery, surgery completion and
              recovery updates. You may unsubscribe from update e-mails at any
              time without affecting the Foundation&rsquo;s ability to
              continue funding the patient&rsquo;s care.
